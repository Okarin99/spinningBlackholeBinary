# spinningBlackholeBinary
Visualization setup for spinning binary black hole scattering. The project consists of the following parts:
- 1PM_deflection.wl: Post-Minkowskian approximation to first order for the trajectory two spinning BHs evaluated by K. Stoldt.
- ancillary.m: Post-Minkowskian approximation to second order for the waveform emitted by two spinning BHs evaluated in the following paper http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.126.201103.
- animateWaveform_*: Visualizations of the radiated waveforms for different configurations
- createHDFFiles.wl: Script that evaluates the trajectory and the waveform on a 3D grid for different timesteps and saves the data inside a HDF5 file.
- scenes/: Different scenes that can be used visualize the data generated by createHDFFiles.wl using the gwpvWithoutSWSH library: https://github.com/Okarin99/gwpvWithoutSWSH
